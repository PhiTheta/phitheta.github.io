<p>I'm working on this webpage out of Curiosity. This site is mostly focused to show case my work and my small attempt to utilize the technology to solve people's problems and provide interesting solutions. I will try to keep this webpage as simple as possible.</p>

<p>I believe in life long learning. I have worked as a Software Engineer for 9 years in Bangalore, India. Right now I am pursuing my dream and studying Space Science and Technology at Lulea University of Technology in Sweden. I enjoy traveling, photography, drawing and swimming apart from my technical and scientific work.</p>
